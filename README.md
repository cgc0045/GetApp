Alarm with questions for Android Development doing by Carlos Gonzalez and Jesus Carro.

It's an alarm that it's necessary to answer a question to stop the alarm.

## Startup Activity

The startup activity is Alarm class. This class is used to startup the app and configure it.

## Synchorinized class

In this app, we try to do that the alarm is synchronized between two devices and the alarm sound in both phones at same time.

The Start class is used to load this part of code. The ConnectUsers class is used to connect the user that configure the alarm with his/her couple using a database.

This part of the code is incomplete and doesn't work due the class can't connect to the database correctly.
